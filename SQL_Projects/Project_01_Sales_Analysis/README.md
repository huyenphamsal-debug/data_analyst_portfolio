# SQL Portfolio Project: Sales & Profit Analysis for Furniture Business

## ðŸ§¾Introduction

Step into the world of retail analytics! This project explores how SQL can transform raw transactional data into valuable business insights â€” uncovering  sales trends,  discount impacts,  top-performing categories, and  employee profitability.

All SQL scripts can be found here: [project_sql folder](./SQL_Projects/Project_01_Sales_Analysis/sql_project)

## ðŸª´ Background

Driven by a passion to strengthen my SQL proficiency and replicate real business analysis scenarios, this project simulates how a retail company evaluates sales performance, profitability, and employee impact across multiple dimensions products, customers, and regions.

Using four interconnected tables Customers, Employees, Orders, and Products. I aimed to answer key business questions that reflect everyday analytical challenges: understanding what drives profit, how discounts affect revenue, and how to automate performance reports for decision-makers.

The dataset structure enabled exploration of end-to-end business analytics from data cleaning and summarization to creating reusable SQL logic through functions and stored procedures, just like a professional data analyst would do in an enterprise setting.

### ðŸ’¡ The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the total sales of furniture products, grouped by each quarter of the year?
2. How do different discount levels impact sales performance and profit across product categories?
3. Which product categories perform best within each customer segment, based on sales and profit?
4. How does each employee perform across product categories, and what percentage of their total profit does each category represent?
5. How can a user-defined function (UDF) be created to calculate the profitability ratio for each product category sold by an employee?
6. How can a stored procedure be developed to calculate total sales and profit for a specific employee over a given date range?
7. How can a dynamic SQL query be used to calculate total profit for the last six quarters, pivoted by quarter and state?


## ðŸ§° Tools I Used
For this retail sales performance analysis, I leveraged several core tools to query, automate, and present insights effectively:
- SQL Server (T-SQL): The core query language used to analyze sales, profit, and performance data.
- Azure Data Studio: A powerful environment for writing, testing, and debugging SQL queries.
- Excel & Power BI: Used for quick validation and visualization of query results where necessary.

## ðŸ“Š The Analysis
Each SQL question was built to solve a realistic business scenario.

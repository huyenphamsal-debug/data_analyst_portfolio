/* Problem 07:
Question: Write a dynamic SQL query to calculate the total profit for the last six quarters 
in the dataset, pivoted by quarter of the year for each state.
- Display total profit per state, broken down by quarter.
- Automatically adjust to always show the most recent six quarters.
- Why? To analyze quarterly profit trends across regions and detect recent performance shifts.

DECLARE @cols NVARCHAR(MAX);

-- ðŸ§© Step 1: Get the last six quarters dynamically
SELECT @cols = STRING_AGG(QUOTENAME(Quarter_Year), ',')

/*

Key Findings:
- Profit distribution varies significantly by state, revealing clear regional leaders.
- Some states exhibit consistent growth, while others show volatility quarter to quarter.
- Q4 generally shows strong profit spikes, likely tied to seasonal demand peaks.

Why It Matters:
Dynamic quarter-based profit tracking provides visibility into regional performance trends,
supporting targeted marketing, regional strategy adjustments, and forecasting decisions.
